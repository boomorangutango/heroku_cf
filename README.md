# treefrog

... testing implementation of Jupyter Notebooks with voila and Heroku.

## Try the following apps to test the capability to use this system.
1. Weld strength calculator. This will test the drawing of layouts for visual reference.
1. Concrete beam sectional strength calculator. This will test the ability to generate graphs, hopefully interactive graphs.
1. AISC shapes sort and filter to pick beams based on Z, d, bf, etc. This will test options for sorting and filtering of database like information and the ability to display tables.
1. Section properties calculator. Might morph into cover plate analysis.
